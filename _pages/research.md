I am deeply interested in talent development. I believe that machine learning and deep learning provide a powerful framework for sports talent development prediction. My long-term goal is to develop methods for learning the patterns of sports talent development directly from data. Currently, my research focuses on the quantitative study of talent development environments, which is a popular area of exploration in sport today. As a Master of Mathematics (Research) student at the University of Malaya, I have conducted research in [Dr Mohd Firdaus Abdullah](https://umexpert.um.edu.my/firdaus-abdullah) and [Dr Mohamad Faithal Hassan](https://umexpert .um.edu.my/faithal) to study the youth football talent development environment in Malaysia and China. For more information about my research, please see some of my works below.

          <p>
            Using the TDEQ-5 framework, the availability and structure of talent development environments in football have been explored for the first time in the Chinese context. The study incorporates cultural pragmatics and interdisciplinary perspectives to examine how contextual factors influence athlete development.<br>
          A context-specific model was developed and applied to empirical data from Chinese youth campus football, demonstrating its effectiveness in evaluating developmental environments across different age groups and informing strategic improvements.
